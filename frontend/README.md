Introduction to Create React App
This project was initialized using Create React App.

Scripts Overview
Within the project directory, you have the following scripts at your disposal:

npm start
Launches the application in development mode.
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload upon making changes.
Lint errors, if any, will be displayed in the console.

npm test
Activates the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the running tests section for additional details.

npm run build
Compiles the application for production into the build folder.
It effectively bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified, and file names include hashes.
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For further information on deployment, consult the deployment documentation.

npm run eject
Note: This is an irreversible action. Once you eject, there is no turning back!

If you find the build tool and configuration choices unsatisfactory, you can execute eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, granting you full control. All commands, excluding eject, will continue to function, now pointing to the copied scripts for customization. At this stage, you're on your own.

Remember, using eject is not mandatory. The curated feature set is designed for small and medium deployments. Feel free to make use of this feature when you're prepared for it.
